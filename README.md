### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p> ðŸ”­ I'm single-handedly building a Q&A LLM chatbot with RAG over documents, 100% privately, with no data leaks. Use cases include but are not limited to reducing troubleshooting time (500% and more) spent by IT staff, automating ~70% of the backup & recovery tool Veeam error handling process, and smooth know-how sharing between team members. </p>

<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, improving my Linux, networking, cloud, containerization, cloud, and DevOps skills.</p>
